    "All of the quantities that we discussed in the [lecture on descriptive statistics](../lectures/descriptive-statistics)---mean, variance, skewness, etc.---are used ubiquitously.  As such, they have already been written up in Python as functions in myriad different ways. implemented many times in Python.  That's how I was able to call `precip_central_park.mean()` for example: the variable is `precip_central_park` is an [xarray.DataArray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.html) object; and DataArrays include [mean](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.mean.html) as a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those built-in implementations in the Python standard library and in reliable packages we'll use like [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://scipy.org/), and [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) are very widely tested for bugs, optimized for performance, and include lots of nice additional features for more complex calculations.  So other than in this assignment, they are what you should use when you need to compute these kinds of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "But they're also kind of a black box---when you call `precip_central_park.mean()`, it doesn't tell you what's happening \"under the hood.\"  It just spits out the result, whether you actually understand the quantity conceptually or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, to make sure we each *do* understand what these different quantities each entail, we'll write each one ourselves as a Python function.  For each one, we'll test it against the built-in version to make sure that they give the right answers.  And along the way we'll learn more about how Python works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to challenge you in two key ways: (1) understanding more deeply the key quantities in descriptive statistics, and (2) understanding more deeply the basics of how Python works."
