This is to help you build the critical scientific skills of *reading carefully*, *thinking critically*, and making *decisions under uncertainty*.  In other words, it's on you to: find what's being asked, make your own plan for how to tackle it, and then execute that plan."

    "## Compare the $t$ and normal distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "In class, we learned that for hypothesis testing of differences in means, the test statistic is called Student's $t$ or just $t$.  The $t$ distribution is similar but not identical to the standard normal distribution, especially for small sample sizes.  Its exact shape depends on the *degrees of freedom*, denoted $\\nu$.  For the difference in two means, this is simply $\\nu=N_1+N_2-2$, where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the sample sizes of the first and second samples, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using [scipy.stats.t.pdf](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.t.html#scipy.stats.t) and [scipy.stats.norm.pdf](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.html#scipy.stats.norm), \n",
    "plot the PDFs of both distributions spanning from -5 to 5.  For the $t$ distribution, overlay 3 different versions on the same axes: $\\nu=1, 10, and 100$.  Add a legend labeling each of these and the normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates that, as the sample sizes grow, the $t$ distribution increasingly is well approximated by the standard normal.  (In fact, it holds mathematically that the $t$ distribution approaches the standard normal exactly as $\\nu\\rightarrow\\infty$.)"

These include blog posts, YouTube videos, tutorials in the documentation to statistical software packages, whole semester-length university classes that have been pre-recorded, and more.
